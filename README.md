AtmService: I have accounted for the fact that more than one users could use the ATM machine at the same point of time. I used exceptions for exceptional cases/error handling. Added java docs for functions, explaining exceptions and return types.

General:  I think the solution should suffice, given the spec. In case more use cases are added later on, the soultion should be able to accomodate them.

I have based the solution on SOLID principles.
